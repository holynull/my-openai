{"prompt":"Why are Their Price Differences for Similar Transactions? ->","completion":" Unlike road transactions, there is no binding contract between blockchain processes. Instead, the data difference will be recorded on the blockchain, with changes. Every transaction on the road uses the token of the specific platform only. For example, you will use the token of MetaPath to transfer tokens on the MetaPath platform only, or use the RMB to exchange for other coins on the onchainfx platform only. The token of the platform has records of different platforms, so you will trade MetaPath tokens with other Ethereum tokens, etc. Every transaction on the blockchain may use different tokens of different projects. That is why they may have a different price; it may not be the same token, but the same transaction. Because the transaction data reported by blockchain projects is based on their own supervisory mechanisms, if the recorded data on the chain gets discolored, you cannot use the token of the corresponding platform to recognize the transaction. Because it is data on the token platform, while the transaction at issue may be carried out with any kind of token. Token platforms will transfer the token themselves to reflect the transactions, which means that the transactions that you carry out through the platform are usually at market rates - even if the transaction you want to carry out is not carried out in the platform. You can always choose the cheaper price through the search tool. However, if you are about to do a transaction, choose to use the token of the platform you are trading on when transferring money, you will not likely encounter problems. However, we recommend that you always pay with cryptocurrency or RMB.\n\nWhy Can the Prices of Coins Change Frequently? As the cryptocurrency is not decentralized, prices tend to be much more volatile than centralized assets. It is very common to see fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly, traders earn a lot of money with these fluctuations. This is because there tends to be patterns to these types of price fluctuations. In this way, there are always opportunities to get rich quick if both attacker and planner can grasp those patterns.  END"}

Hence, there may be instances when it takes longer for the process to be completed due to market conditions or high request rate. Also, An innovative technology such as SWFT Blockchain requires breaks in communication when carrying out complex operations such as instant cross-chain transfers. Another factor contributing to the increase of communication times is the number of transactions in the blockchain, which may arise during peak periods. These factors make it difficult for MetaPath to track the status of the transaction in real time. This will make the interface appear as if the exchange process isn’t complete when it actually has been.\n\nBecause of these factors, we have decided to take a step back and explore solutions that will improve the user experience by trying different approaches to inform the users of the status of the transactions, as well as allowing them to track their transaction status directly on the blockchain explorer.

This triggers a rate prediction error with Web3MetaPath interfaces, as the MetaPath smart contracts of the provider are unable to predict the status of your transaction. To resolve this error, we have updated the contracts already; web interfaces will follow suit.\n\nRate disparity: The discrepancy between rates that you see on Web3MetaPath due to the inclusion of transaction fees are usually negligible in most contracts. They are usually due to a slight discrepancy in the time when your transaction arrives on the blockchain and when we record the rate from the blockchain explorer.\n\n“How Long Does It Take for Fees to Appear on My Interface?”\n\nWhen you use MetaPath, fees are automatically recorded and reflected on your transactions.

We have to send them to the market makers where they can be traded.”\n\n“Okay, wouldn’t it just be cheaper to change the addresses?”\n\nMetaPath: “If all transactions were done through the blockchain, it would be cheap and instant. But due to how cryptocurrencies were designed - with cross-chain communication not considered - all transactions are recorded into databases on the blockchains, like your Coinbase. From there, the transaction details are put into a contract and signed, sent to the chain and filled by the miners. Third party block explorers search the chains and databases for the transaction in order to verify it. Once they have confirmed the token swap, they present that back to the users so they can confirm, once they have confirmed the transaction they back it out of the databases, into the smart contract and the entire process can again be confirmed on the blockchain.

{"prompt":"What is NFT? ->","completion":" \n\nWith NFT, users can transact in digital assets without accessing the blockchain network. The NFT Protocol will connect multiple off-chain platforms to make cryptocurrency transactions faster, safer and cheaper. Users will be able to combine their holdings across all platforms in a single interface. Users will also be able to access all the functions within the protocol, regardless of the different platforms they come from.\n\nWhat is tokenization?\n\nTokenization is the act of attributing an asset or benefit to a token or code, which can be executed by the wallet and sent across the blockchain. Tokenization creates an interface that exists between companies and consumers. Anyone with a smart device, such as a mobile phone, can receive a token or tokenized information, whether it be a share of a company, a tangible item on the blockchain, a virtual gift card, a subscription or even a resource such as energy or bandwidth.\n\nIs the NFT Protocol related to chain analysis?\n\nNo. The NFT Protocol is a blockchain standard that integrates wallets and swaps across chains. The chain analysis is a feature of the NFT Protocol, allowing the user to track the transaction flow between wallets and swap markets. However, the NFT Protocol has no ability to identify specific addresses and wallets.\n\nWill there be fees for using the NFT Protocol?\n\nThere will be fees for using the NFT Protocol. Fees will be low, however, and transparent to the user. Because users can swap between several wallets and\/or swap markets on the go, the transactions will be cheaper than individual transactions.\n\nAre there any other costs or fees involved in the NFT Protocol?\n\nThere will be fees incurred in carry trades, which is the algorithm used to execute token trades on the protocol. For example, the price of purchasing tokens or cryptocurrencies through the NFT Protocol will be much less expensive than purchasing them on a traditional market. There are always risks involved in cross-border transactions and trading platforms, however, this will be a transparent process, and users can choose the exchange that’s best for them based on their risk appetite.\n\nIs the NFT Protocol related to XCP and CIV:Fi?\n\nBoth CIV:Fi and XCP are independent advancements to the NFT Protocol. Users would be able to use one chain of the NFT Protocol, such as the TIER Network Chain Protocol, for all their NFT transactions.\n\n END"}

{"prompt":"What is NFT? ->","completion":" NFT stands for non-fungible token, a token that cannot be replaced by another token with the same characteristics, similar to how different and unique collectible items are non-fungible. An NFT asset record is represented by a NFT blockchain smart contract and contains metadata about the asset. That smart contract holds information about the asset owner (individuals and organizations, identified using an unalterable public key), the asset itself, transactions that have taken place with the token, and the blockchain address of the token storing the metadata. The actual item being transacted is removed from the transaction, making the process more streamlined. While most cryptocurrencies are fungible, one can swap cryptocurrencies without affecting its mechanism or ownership, like going to an exchange and swapping out tokens for other tokens. NFTs aim to improve on the fungibility and security of digital assets. For example, whenever there is a request, the regulations with the digital token change all together.           Confidentiality: All NFT transfers create a transaction log, which is publicly visible and not encrypted. However, only the metadata of the asset is visible, and not the identity of the owner or the asset itself. Speed: Through cross-chain transactions, NFT transactions occur on multiple chains in parallel. Millions of transactions per second can be handled without delay and without congestion. Scalability: NFT operations take place on multiple blockchains, and the complexity of any single blockchain transaction is parallelized among a cluster of blockchain nodes. Security: Through storage of assets in smart contracts, theft and loss of assets is impossible, and any asset you need can always be tracked. Standards, Portability and interoperability of NFT: The development of a globalized standard, encompassing methodologies and standards.\n     Also, NFT is open to the world and can be used in combination with and exchanged with thousands of blockchain powered tokens and contracts.
